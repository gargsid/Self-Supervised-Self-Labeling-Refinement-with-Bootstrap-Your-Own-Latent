# Self-Supervised-Self-Labeling-Refinement-with-Bootstrap-Your-Own-Latent
Self Labeling Refinement procedure in Self-Supervised framework Bootstrap Your Own Latent (BYOL)

Introduced two new loss functions for learning robust image representations for doing self-labeling refinement. 

1. Cross-cosine Similarity Loss (CCSL)
2. Cross-Sigmoid Similarity Loss (CSSL)

Following are the screenshots from the paper
